      <div className="myInfo">
        <p>I am an AI+Astro research scientist working at Stanford University. Prior to that, I was a Carnegie-Princeton fellow at Carnegie Observations.

 

I am interested in galaxy evolution, supermassive black holes and their impact on their hosts, and the physics of the interstellar medium. In my research, I combine dedicated multi-wavelength observations with analysis of large astronomical surveys, and am particularly interested in applications of machine learning and data science tools to extract novel information from astronomical datasets.</p>
