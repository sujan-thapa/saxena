      <p>
        I am a motivated and enthusiastic person aiming to set my mind and work towards it. 
        After my graduation, I joined a purpose-driven project in mySecondTeacher.com, which 
        has served millions of students through its web and mobile platform. Besides this, 
        I have sharpened my analytical and research skills while working on personal projects. 
        I believe by pursuing higher education, I will be able to master the latest technologies 
        in inter-cultural teams.
